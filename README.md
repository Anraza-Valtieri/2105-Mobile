# Project InfoMed [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sgtech-ict2105/ict2105-team03-2018.svg?token=3masyc29oRiGrR2pxQ2u&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sgtech-ict2105/ict2105-team03-2018)

Many families with elderly members will have a messaging chat group, 
to update each other of the health and medical status of the elderly member. 
However as time goes by, such chat groups become cluttered with information and and casual chat, 
making it difficult and inefficient to search for the information when needed, such as during a medical appointment. 
It is also common to for family members to take turns providing care. 
The family member caring for the elderly will then need to be aware of the medical information by either painstakingly search the chat group, or asking another family member. Both ways risk leaving out crucial information. 

With the above problem, our group came up with an idea for a mobile application called InfoMed. Infomed is an all-in-one medical logger that transforms the idea of having a messaging group chat for medical status updates, into a platform to share those information in a neat, organized, and efficient manner. 

The app will provide some basic features that are available for all users that wish to log their medical information for personal reference. Those features will allow users to:
* View their medical conditions (past and present)
* View their past medical appointment details
* View their upcoming medical appointment details
* View current medication and its usage instructions
* Set up medication reminders
* Keep track of medical bills

When a user adds a caregiver (family member or friend), all information can then be shared with the caregiver. Additional features will also become available. With at least 1 caregiver added, a user can also send a SMS to all caregivers during an emergency. 

The added caregiver(s) will be able to:
* View and update all of the above mentioned information
* Set up medication reminders for the elderly
* View status of medication reminders
* Add comments or additional information in the appointment page for other caregiversâ€™ reference
